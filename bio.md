Shawn Holley is an American visual and musical artist best known as the founder, singer-songwriter, and creative force behind the alternative rock band Mythological Horses. Born and raised in Anchorage, Alaska, Holley's musical journey began in his teens and has spanned decades of relentless touring, genre-blending songwriting, and DIY rock & roll ethos.

Fronting Mythological Horses, Holley has led the band from punk-infused beginnings to richly textured indie and garage rock, releasing multiple full-length albums and performing across the United States, including headlining festivals like the New York Anti-Folk Festival.

Holley's artistic vision extends beyond music into painting and other visual forms. In interviews and creative projects he's discussed exploring personal themes—including mental illness, identity, and lived experience—while often creating work in tandem with performance or conversation, blending spontaneity with introspection.

His artwork mirrors his musical energy: bold, unpredictable, and expressive, with a kinetic blend of punk rock urgency and imaginative surrealism. Whether through song or on canvas, Holley invites audiences into a world where raw emotion and creative freedom collide.
